# iOS Setup Instructions

The iOS platform setup is incomplete. Run these commands to properly initialize it:

```bash
# 1. Clean any partial iOS setup
rm -rf ios/

# 2. Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# 3. Add iOS platform (this should create all necessary files)
npx cap add ios

# 4. Sync the project
npx cap sync ios

# 5. Verify the setup worked
ls -la ios/App/
```

You should see these files created:
- `ios/App/Podfile`
- `ios/App/App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `ios/App/App/Info.plist` âœ“ (already exists)

**If you still don't see the Podfile and .xcodeproj directory after running these commands, please share the output of the `npx cap add ios` command so I can help troubleshoot.**

Once these files exist, I can update the iOS deployment target to 15.0 and Swift version to 5.9 for newer Xcode compatibility.

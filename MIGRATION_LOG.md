## Data Transformations
- **Phone numbers**: Normalized to E.164 format with `tel:` prefix
  - `1-800-669-4000` → `tel:+18006694000`
  - `1-877-NAACP-98` → `tel:+18776222298`
  - `1-844-762-NLRB` → `tel:+18447626572`
  - `1-800-321-OSHA` → `tel:+18003216742`

- **Internal links**: Preserved as anchor/hash links for future UI wiring
  - Emergency contacts tool → `#emergency-contacts`
  - State commissions → `#state-commissions`
  - Legal aid → `#legal-aid`

- **IDs**: Generated kebab-case stable IDs from titles
  - "NAACP (National Association...)" → `naacp`
  - "U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)" → `us-department-of-labor`

## Items with Special Handling
- **Emergency Contact List**: Interactive tool, preserved action reference
- **Safety Protocols**: Document without external link, added placeholder action
- **State-specific resources**: ACLU phone and state commissions marked as "varies by state/location"

## Validation Status
✅ All items have required fields (id, title, tag, description, actions)
✅ All phone numbers properly formatted with `tel:` prefix
✅ All external links use HTTPS
✅ No duplicate IDs across groups

## Missing/Inferred Data
- No missing descriptions or purposes from original data
- All contact information was present in original source
- Tag values mapped from original `type` field

## Next Steps
Ready for UI implementation:
1. Dropdown buttons styled per screenshot
2. Modal with Title + Tag pill + Description + Purpose + Contact links
3. Search/filter functionality
4. Analytics event tracking

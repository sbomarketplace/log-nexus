# Incident Reporting Guidelines

## Purpose
Clear, timely reporting protects you, helps fix problems quickly, and creates a defensible record.

## When to Report
- Safety hazards or near-misses  
- Injuries/illnesses and first aid events  
- Harassment, discrimination, bullying, threats, retaliation  
- Policy, security, or privacy violations  
- Property damage, theft, substance use concerns  
- Any incident that made you feel unsafe or targeted

**If you're unsure—report it.** It's better to record and update later.

## Emergencies
- **Immediate danger?** Call 911 or site emergency number first.  
- After the situation is stable, record the incident as soon as practical.

## What to Include (the 6W+H)
- **Who:** people directly involved + witnesses (full names if possible).  
- **What:** objective facts—what happened in order, quotes if exact.  
- **When:** date and exact time (or best estimate).  
- **Where:** specific location (building, room, area).  
- **Why/Context:** what led up to it, prior events.  
- **How:** actions taken, tools/items involved, communications.  
- **Impact:** injuries, disruption, property damage, feelings of safety.  
- **Follow-up:** who you told, instructions received, next steps.

## Evidence to Attach
- Photos/video (time-stamped), audio (if lawful), screenshots, emails, chat logs, access logs, incident numbers, medical notes, work orders.  
- Keep originals; upload copies.

## Writing Tips
- Stick to facts; mark opinions clearly.  
- Use quotes for exact statements.  
- Avoid labels; describe behavior.  
- One paragraph per event in the order it occurred.  
- If you estimate, say so (e.g., "about 3:45 PM").

## Privacy & Non-Retaliation
Reports are handled as confidentially as possible. Retaliation for reporting is prohibited and should be reported immediately.

## After You Submit
1. You receive a record number (case #).  
2. Triage: safety & medical needs first, then evidence preservation.  
3. You may be contacted for clarification or an interview.  
4. You'll be informed of the outcome as policy allows.

## Timelines
- **Log within 24 hours** when possible; sooner is better.  
- Update your report as new facts or documents appear.

## Special Notes
- **Harassment/Discrimination:** capture exact words/gestures and context.  
- **Substance concerns:** describe behaviors/odors; **do not** speculate on diagnoses.  
- **Union involvement:** you may request representation; note names and roles.

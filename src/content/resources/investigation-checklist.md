# Investigation Checklist

> Use this checklist to plan, conduct, and close an investigation. Keep it with the case file.

## Intake & Triage
- [ ] Log report; assign **case #** and investigator.  
- [ ] Address **immediate safety/medical** needs.  
- [ ] Preserve evidence (CCTV retention, logs, devices).  
- [ ] Conflict check (investigator impartiality).  
- [ ] Notify required parties (HR, Security, Legal, Union per policy).  
- [ ] Consider interim measures (schedule changes, no-contact, escorts).

## Plan
- [ ] Define **allegations/questions to answer**.  
- [ ] Identify policies/laws potentially implicated.  
- [ ] Draft witness list and document list.  
- [ ] Set timeline & milestones.

## Collect Documents
- [ ] Photos/video/screen captures  
- [ ] Access/time records, schedules, work orders  
- [ ] Emails/chats/messages  
- [ ] Training records, prior related incidents  
- [ ] Medical/first-aid notes (if applicable)

## Interviews
- [ ] Interview order set (complainant → witnesses → subject).  
- [ ] Provide representation options if applicable.  
- [ ] Prepare topics; avoid leading questions.  
- [ ] Record date/time, participants, location, and permissions.  
- [ ] Obtain written statements or investigator summaries.  
- [ ] Debrief and offer support/resources.

**Trauma-informed tips:** allow breaks, avoid judgmental language, ask open-ended questions, clarify sequence.

## Analysis
- [ ] Build a **timeline** of corroborated facts.  
- [ ] Assess credibility/consistency; compare accounts to artifacts.  
- [ ] Apply policy elements to facts (who/what/when/where).  
- [ ] Determine findings (substantiated / unsubstantiated / inconclusive).

## Report & Actions
- [ ] Write findings summary (facts, analysis, policy).  
- [ ] Recommend corrective actions (coaching, discipline, training, environmental fixes).  
- [ ] Document remedial/safety measures already taken.

## Communicate & Close
- [ ] Notify parties of outcome as policy allows (no confidential details).  
- [ ] Provide resources (EAP, safety contacts, reporting channels).  
- [ ] Record retention tagged with **case #**, dates, and index of evidence.  
- [ ] Schedule follow-up check-in (e.g., 30/60 days).  
- [ ] Lessons learned fed to safety/HR for prevention.
